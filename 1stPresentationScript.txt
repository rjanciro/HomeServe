**A REAL-TIME HOME SERVICES PLATFORM WITH MERN & SOCKET.IO**
1st Research Presentation Script

[SLIDE 1: TITLE]
Good morning/afternoon everyone. Today, I'm presenting my research project titled "A Real-Time Home Services Platform with MERN & Socket.IO." This platform, which I've named HomeServeConnect, aims to revolutionize how homeowners connect with service providers.

[SLIDE 2: PROPONENT PROFILE]
I'm Renz Joshua T. Anciro, a BSIT student at Gordon College - College of Computer Studies. This project represents the culmination of my studies and passion for developing solutions that meet real community needs.

[SLIDE 3: PROJECT ADVISER]
My project adviser brings over 5 years of mobile app development experience, with expertise in iOS/Android development, full-stack web development, TypeScript, and the Ionic Framework. Their experience developing solutions for over 100 Australian clients provides valuable guidance for this project.

[SLIDE 4-5: USER PROFILES]
HomeServeConnect addresses the needs of two key user groups:

First, homeowners seeking reliable services and local community members needing household repairs. These users face challenges finding trustworthy professionals and coordinating service appointments.

Second, service providers looking to grow their businesses. As an example of our target service provider, consider Park 'N Bath - a mobile pet grooming salon based in Olongapo. As the first and only mobile pet grooming service in Zambales and Bataan, they offer unique services but need better tools for customer acquisition and booking management.

[SLIDE 6: INTRODUCTION]
HomeServeConnect is a web platform that connects homeowners with trusted service providers. It simplifies the process of finding, vetting, and booking professionals for home repairs and maintenance. The platform addresses a critical gap in our local market where finding reliable service providers often relies on word-of-mouth recommendations.

[SLIDE 7: PROJECT OBJECTIVES]
The primary objectives of HomeServeConnect are to:
- Connect homeowners with verified service providers
- Equip providers with tools for managing services and bookings
- Ensure trust through a robust verification system
- Simplify the home service booking process
- Enable direct communication via in-app messaging

Our verification system is particularly important as research shows it significantly impacts customer satisfaction.

[SLIDE 8: PROJECT SIGNIFICANCE]
HomeServeConnect will build trust in the home service industry by reducing the time spent searching for reliable providers. The platform creates new opportunities for service professionals to grow their business while improving home maintenance through qualified services. By connecting local providers with homeowners, we're also supporting community development.

[SLIDE 9: TARGET END USERS & SOLUTION]
Our target end users include:
- Homeowners needing trusted services
- Service providers aiming to grow their client base
- Platform administrators managing operations

Our solution provides a user-friendly platform featuring provider verification, secure messaging, booking and scheduling tools, and comprehensive profile management.

[SLIDE 10: PROJECT SCOPE, LIMITATIONS & EXPECTED OUTCOMES]
HomeServeConnect's scope includes:
- A responsive web application with user authentication
- Role-based access control
- Service provider verification
- A comprehensive booking system
- Integrated payment processing
- Real-time messaging
- Admin dashboard
- Rating and review system

We do face some limitations, primarily geographic constraints based on provider availability and limited payment methods in our initial release.

The expected outcomes include increased trust in the home service industry, a simplified booking process, improved communication between parties, and higher satisfaction for both homeowners and service providers.

[SLIDE 11: DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY]
I'll be using an Agile methodology with a user-centered design approach. The technical foundation will be the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. Real-time communication capabilities will be implemented using WebSocket technology, specifically Socket.IO. The system will follow RESTful API architecture with continuous integration and testing.

[SLIDE 12: HARDWARE & SOFTWARE]
For hardware, I'll utilize development laptops/desktops and appropriate server infrastructure for deployment.

The software stack includes:
- Frontend: React.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- State Management: React Context API
- Routing: React Router
- UI Components: React Icons, SweetAlert2
- Development tools: Vite, ESLint
- Notifications: React Hot Toast
- HTTP Client: Axios

This stack was selected for its performance, scalability, and suitability for real-time applications.

[SLIDE 13-15: REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE]
My research is supported by several key studies:

First, research on Digital Service Marketplaces published in the Journal of Service Research (2022) found that verification systems increased customer satisfaction by 34%. This directly supports HomeServeConnect's provider verification approach.

Second, a study on Digital Transformation for Service Providers in the International Journal of Information Management (2023) revealed that service providers using digital platforms experience 35-45% more bookings and more stable income. This confirms HomeServeConnect's potential value to service providers in the Philippines.

Third, research on Payment Systems in Service Marketplaces by Zhou et al. (2022) found that escrow payments increase trust by 47% and reduce disputes by 78%, while 89% of Southeast Asian users prefer mobile payment options. These findings inform our payment system design.

[SLIDE 16: RESOURCES & BUDGET]
Regarding human resources, I'll be handling all aspects of the project, including frontend and backend development, UI/UX design, testing, project management, and deployment.

The software resources include development tools, hosting services, domain services, and third-party APIs.

The budget breakdown is:
- Frontend & Backend Tools: Free (using React.js, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Figma)
- Third-Party APIs: ₱1,000/month
- Hosting & Deployment: Free for basic services, with additional features costing ₱500-₱1,000/month
- Domain Name Registration: ₱500-₱1,000
- Miscellaneous Expenses (marketing): ₱2,000

[SLIDE 17: TIMELINE/SCHEDULE OF ACTIVITIES]
The project spans 3.5 months from February to May. Key phases include requirements gathering in February, project planning and system design in March, wireframing and development in April, followed by payment integration, testing, deployment, and documentation in May.

[SLIDE: PROJECT EXPECTED OUTPUT]
These are our login and registration interfaces. Both feature clean, responsive design with intuitive navigation. Users can register as either homeowners or service providers, determining their access to specific platform features.

[SLIDE: HOME OWNERS CAN]
Homeowners can message service providers directly through our real-time chat system and manage their personal information through customizable profile settings.

[SLIDE: SERVICE OWNERS CAN]
Service providers can create detailed service listings with customizable parameters and manage their offerings through an intuitive dashboard that allows for easy editing and removal of services.

[SLIDE: SERVICE PROVIDERS CAN]
Service providers can review and accept booking requests from homeowners and mark services as completed once the job is finished, maintaining an organized record of their service history.

[SLIDE: CUSTOMER VALIDATION]
Survey data confirms our target market needs. Service providers span different age groups and genders, offering various services including general maintenance, electrical work, and house cleaning. Most currently rely on word-of-mouth and social media for client acquisition, highlighting the opportunity for our platform.

[SLIDE: CUSTOMER VALIDATION (CONTINUED)]
Our survey reveals key pain points: 83% of providers struggle with getting consistent job requests, while 60% face unreliable clients. Most (53%) prefer cash payments, with 47% open to digital options. For scheduling, 80% use traditional methods but 100% expressed interest in using a digital platform to manage bookings—validating our solution's market fit.

[SLIDE: CUSTOMER VALIDATION (FEATURES)]
Our survey identified the most valuable features for service providers: 100% want real-time client communication, 93% desire customer ratings and reviews, and 87% need location-based service requests and job history tracking. This confirms that our core features—messaging, reviews, location services, and job management—align perfectly with provider needs.
